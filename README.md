The Helsinki city bike dataset for 2017 has not been published openly as of this date. This map uses data acquired from City Bike Finland and HSL in collaboration with the Accessibility Research Group of the University of Helsinki.

The awesome HSL style map tiles in the background are kindly provided by Digitransit via their **[open API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/3-map-api/background-map/)**
